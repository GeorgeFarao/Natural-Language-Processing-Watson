# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing projects using IBM's Watson.

## Text_to_specch
  Converts text, either given by the user or from a file to speech.
  
## Language Translation
  This project has three parts. First we implement a simple translation method, that translates text from one language to another. Then we create a language identifier that identifies the language of a given text. Finally we create an AI Travel Guide, which given a text, it translates it to the language that we want and then it converts it to speech.

## Video_To_Text
  In this project we convert a video to text. To do this first we extract the video's audio and then we convert it to text , while processing it a bit, so that it's easier to read.
